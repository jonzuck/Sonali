            <h2> Virginia Solar Pathways Project </h2>
            <p class="floatleft"> The ultimate goal for the Virginia Solar Pathways Project (VSPP) is to develop a collaborative utility-administered solar strategy for the Commonwealth of Virginia. The process will (i) integrate existing solar programs with new options appropriate for Virginia policy environment and broader economic development objectives; (ii) promote wider deployment of solar within a low rate environment; and (iii) serve as a replicable model for use by other states with similar policy environments, including but not limited to the entire Southeast region.</p>
            <p class="floatright">The Project will engage a Core Advisory Team made up of a diverse group of stakeholders. The Core Advisory Team will consist of a state government agency, an environmental organization, local community representatives, research and educational institutions, and a solar installation company. In addition to the Core Advisory Team, Dominion Virginia Power (DVP) envisions providing additional opportunities to receive input from and share information on Project accomplishments with other interested stakeholders. For example, the Commonwealth recently announced the creation of a Solar Energy Development Authority (SEDA). To the extent possible, the Project will collaborate with and provide information to the SEDA once it is established.</p>

                        <p>Purpose:
                            The goal of this work is to assess the key areas of capabilities to successfully integrate solar distributed generation (DG) onto the grid. This study will provide a roadmap for the utility as to what operational areas to focus their attention to support solar DG integration. The study will focus on the full cycle of solar DG â€“ from interconnection requests to operating on the grid

                                    effective operation. The goal should be to proactively plan in a way that avoids the pitfalls of others that
                                    may have added too many variable energy resources (VERs) too fast without sufficient preplanning.</p>

                <h3>How can Broken Hill became a solar power trailblazer</h3>
                <img src= "brokenhill.jpg" alt="Power trailblazer" class="floatleft" >

                    <p>
                    Broken Hill spawned the world's largest mining company and generated more than $75 billion in wealth. Now as its minerals ebb, Australia's longest-lived mining city is looking to tap a more abundant resource.
                    On the sun-baked edge of the outback city, 700 miles west of Sydney, a solar farm the size of London's Hyde Park shimmers like an oasis - its panels sending enough electricity to the national grid to power 17,000 homes a year
                    Combined with a sister plant, the AGL Energy and First Solar project is the largest of its type in the southern hemisphere.Clean energy advocates are counting on the 140-hectare development to make Broken Hill, which at one time boasted the world's most successful silver mine, a trailblazer once again.
